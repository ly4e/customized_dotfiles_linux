    The above course is where i took the inspiration to start over with my zshrc file and see about creating something more trimmed.

## ZSH
This zshrc config file: 
- leverages "zgenom" as its plugin manager
- recreates a "fish" style abbreviated working directory
- recreated "fish" style abbreviated aliases for the purpose of staying familair with the actual commands in case we end up on a system without our aliases
- custom prompt includes git information enrichment and abbreviated working directories

---
## TMUX
This tmux.conf file:
- leverages "tmux-resurrect" && "tmux-continuum" to assist in having tmux sessions persist thru a reboot
- remapped command sequences for splitting screens
- remapped prefix to to emulate "screen"

## Alacritty
alacritty.yml present provides a slightler larger font and a non-default color scheme

## VIM
vimrc containing some custom tweaks and plugin configurations
